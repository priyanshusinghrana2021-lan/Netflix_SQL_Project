## Objective
Import and manage large datasets in PostgreSQL.
Write optimized SQL queries using SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and JOIN concepts.
Perform country-specific analysis (e.g., India-based content).
Handle missing and textual data (duration, genres, ratings).
Generate insights useful for reporting and visualization.

## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the kaggle datset.
